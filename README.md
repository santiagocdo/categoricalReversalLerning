# the task
The experiment implemented in this repository has two versions: easy (4 exemplars) and hard (8 exemplars).

In this within-subject experiment each participant will be randomly selected to start between one of two tasks (Total and Partial reversal). Participants will end one task then move to the next. Each task contain two phases: Training and Reversal. Both tasks are the same in training:

## Phase 1 - Training 
Hard: 8 blocks with 2 presentation of each examplar each, 16 trials per exemplar
Easy: 4 blocks with 2 presentation of each examplar each, 8 trials per exemplar

### Partial and Total:
Ex1 - Cat1;
Ex2 - Cat1;
Ex3 - Cat1;
Ex4 - Cat1;
Ex5 - Cat2;
Ex6 - Cat2;
Ex7 - Cat2;
Ex8 - Cat2;

But the tasks differ in the Reversal second phase:

## Phase 2 - Reversal
Hard: 4 blocks with 2 presentation of each examplar each, 8 trials per exemplar
Easy: 4 blocks with 2 presentation of each examplar each, 8 trials per exemplar

### Total:
Ex1 - Cat2;
Ex2 - Cat2;
Ex3 - Cat2;
Ex4 - Cat2;
Ex5 - Cat1;
Ex6 - Cat1;
Ex7 - Cat1;
Ex8 - Cat1;

### Partial:
Ex1 - Cat1;
Ex2 - Cat1;
Ex3 - Cat2;
Ex4 - Cat2;
Ex5 - Cat2;
Ex6 - Cat2;
Ex7 - Cat1;
Ex8 - Cat1;
